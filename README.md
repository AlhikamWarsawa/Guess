1. To provide an entertaining and challenging game.
2. To demonstrate the basic usage of Python in creating a simple game.
3. To practice programming logic and handling user input.
4. To offer an example of a well-organized Python project structure.

## Features (Coming Soon)
- Adjustable difficulty levels
- Scoring system
- User-friendly text-based interface

## Project Structure
- **main.py**: The main file used to run the game.
- **utils/**: A folder containing utility modules.
  - **__init__.py**: Marks the `utils` folder as a Python package.
  - **game_functions.py**: Contains the logic functions that support the game.
- **tests/**: A folder for unit tests.
  - **test_guess_game.py**: Contains unit tests to ensure the game logic works as expected.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.
